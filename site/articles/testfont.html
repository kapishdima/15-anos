              <p>Planning a quince includes a lot of spendigns, so sometimes you have to decide where to cut your costs. However, there are some simple tips to save money without giving up anything important. 
                <br><br><strong>1. Centerpieces.</strong> They are an essential part of your décor and help build the theme of a party. But, as it is just a décor item, with no useful functions – it would be easy to make it by yourself. You can easily find different types of centerpieces that are made with use of a particular home décor items, like vases. So you can choose vase that you like and fill it with the items you like, glass balls, artificial flowers, etc. It may give you about 50-80% economy and even higher level of customization!
                <br><br><strong>2. Coreography.</strong> Nowadays there are a lot of video tutorials on any of the popular dances for Quinceanera party. If you and your court of honor are well organized you can easily learn any dance. Just practice it!
                <br><br><strong>3. Dj.</strong>3. Hire DJ instead of an artist. Dj’s are way more affordable. Or maybe you can even find Dj among your friends.
                <br><br><strong>4. Invitations.</strong>4. Make your own invitations. Other option is to create a free online or <a href="https://quinceanera.app.link/welcome">mobile app invitation</a>.</p>

                style="width:100%" class="w3-padding-16">
                <p><br><br><strong>5. Padrinos.</strong>5. Get funds from padrinos. If your budget is about to expire it may be a good moment to ask your padrinos to participate.
                <br><br><strong>6. Cake.</strong>6. You can save a lot of money if you find an individual who’s making cakes. You can search for them in the web. It should be way cheaper than buying it from a catering company or a dessert shop.
                <br><br><strong>7. Mass.</strong>7. If there is an option you can set you mess to the day after any celebration, like Easter. The benefit is that the church should still be decorated, so you do not pay for that. Other way to save money on that it to cooperate with any other quinceanera who has a mess in the same day. So you can split the costs on decorations between you both.
                <br><br><strong>8. Limo.</strong>8. Use coupon websites to look for a limo service. Sometimes it can save you about 50%!
                <br><br><strong>9. Sweet table.</strong>9. Sweet table could be definetely be done by yourself or padrinos. Just buy whatever you want from the local shops or order it.
                <br><br><strong>10. Venue.</strong>10. Schedule the event on the less popular date. There could be a dramatic change in price for Saturday comparing to other days. So ask your venue about other days – maybe you’ll find an ideal offer.
                <br><br><strong>11. Makeup.</strong>11. Ask someone to make your makeup. Choose an example of what you want and ask your family and friends if someone can help you with it. It would be great to do a trial before the quince day to be sure that it fits your expectations.
